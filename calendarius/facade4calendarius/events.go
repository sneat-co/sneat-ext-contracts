// EventHappeningsFacade exposes the canonical Calendarius Event-Happening
// lifecycle without leaking DBOs or slot schemas. EventID is the returned
// Happening ID; there is no parallel Event entity.
//
// Every method first validates finite principal/Space/reference IDs, then
// authorizes userID against spaceID before revealing or mutating state. Create
// and Update use one durable receipt namespace keyed by
// (userID, spaceID, RequestID). The receipt stores operation, target, the
// normative canonical full-payload fingerprint, the original mutation
// projection, and one audit fact. Receipt creation and the Happening mutation
// are one transaction. An identical replay returns the originally recorded
// Event projection with disposition=reused even if the Event has since changed;
// it creates no Happening, receipt, or audit duplicate. Reusing that scope with
// another payload, target, or operation returns ErrRequestIDConflict. The same
// RequestID under another principal or Space is independent.
//
// Create may atomically persist initial canonical Happening-owned prices, and
// returned EventHappening projections include them. This facade does not create
// a parallel Event price authority: callers select distinct prices by their
// stable HappeningPrice item IDs and use the existing generic Happening pricing
// command surface for later price edits.
//
// A recurring yearly `kind=event` Happening is an annual Series/Cup root;
// single nodes are its editions, Tournaments and games. Recurrence remains
// owned by the existing RecurringHappeningsFacade, never this Event facade.
//
// ParentHappeningID is an immutable first-release attachment convenience. It
// never creates a second hierarchy authority: providers derive projections
// from and atomically write reciprocal standard Sneat Linkage parent/child
// roles plus RelatedIDs. A child create validates the same-Space canonical
// parent and its expected version, rejects a corrupt/cyclic ancestor chain, and
// commits both Linkage endpoints with the child, receipt, prices, and audit.
// Attaching a child increments the canonical parent's Version in that same
// transaction. Parent attachment is immutable here; this contract has no Move
// operation.
